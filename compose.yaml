services:
  frontend:
    image: mbienaimee/todo-frontend:latest # Or just todo-frontend:latest if built locally
    ports:
      - "80:80" # Map host port 80 to container port 80 (Nginx)
    depends_on:
      - backend # Ensures backend starts before frontend (optional, but good practice)

  backend:
    image: mbienaimee/todo-backend:latest # Or just todo-backend:latest if built locally
    ports:
      - "3001:3001" # Map host port 3001 to container port 3001 (Node.js)
    environment:
      # If your backend needs to know the frontend URL or other environment variables, define them here
      # For example, if your backend needs to connect to a database service named 'db'
      # DATABASE_URL: "mongodb://db:27017/todoapp"
      # For now, if no env vars are needed, this section can be omitted or left blank.
      NODE_ENV: production # Example environment variable for Node.js
    # If your backend needs a database, you'd add another service here and link it
    # For instance, if you had a MongoDB service:
    # depends_on:
    #   - db
# The 'db' service example (if needed later) and the 'volumes' section have been removed
# because they were causing the error and are not currently active in your setup.
